# KAGGLE-RSNA-Screening-Mammography-Breast-Cancer-Detection

augment-rsna.ipynb was used for doing "minority focused oversampling" and RSNA-BreastCancer Pipeline(Torch).ipynb notebook contains my training pipeline. i know my code is messy and lacks documentation. actually i tried a lot of things in that competition and most of them didn't work and i was not able to design a robust solution that i badly wanted to,that's why i didn't bother documenting my pipeline comprehensively,stil i hope somehow it helps someone.
